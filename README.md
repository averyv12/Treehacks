# Treehacks

My friend and I compete at the Stanford Treehacks competition this past year. Under a time contraint, our final product was a webpage that tracks your eyes and detects whether or not you have fallen asleep. If you have fallen asleep, your computer will begin to play a loud siren. The original idea was to have your computer sent a signal to your phone and have your phone buzz until you woke up. Unfortunately, given the time constraints, we were not able to do this. Hoping to implement this later on.
